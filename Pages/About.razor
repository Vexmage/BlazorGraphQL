    <p class="mt-4">
        This project is a personal and philosophical take on digital book tracking — a catalog of both my <strong>Library</strong> (books I’ve read) and my <strong>Anti-Library</strong> (books I have yet to read, but aspire to).
    </p>

    <p>
        The application is built using:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blazor Server</strong> for frontend + component-based architecture</li>
            <li><strong>GraphQL</strong> via HotChocolate for querying and mutations</li>
            <li><strong>EF Core + SQLite</strong> for lightweight relational storage</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        It features book tracking with categories, progress bars, and reflections. You can add and remove books, and future improvements will include editing, user auth, and tagging.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
        The design embraces a vintage reading aesthetic, reflecting my own background in philosophy and love for knowledge curation.
