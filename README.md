# 📚 BlazorGraphQL Book Catalog

A Blazor Server app that explores the idea of a **Library** and **Anti-Library** — inspired by Nassim Taleb's concept that unread books hold more potential than read ones.

This project uses a **GraphQL API** with **EF Core + SQLite** to store and manage a personal catalog of books, along with reading progress and reflections. It demonstrates full-stack Blazor development with a strong architectural foundation.

---

## 🚀 Overview

BlazorGraphQL integrates **GraphQL** using HotChocolate, providing an efficient and flexible API for fetching, adding, and deleting books. It complements REST with a single declarative endpoint for structured queries.

### 🔥 Why GraphQL?

- **Efficient Data Fetching** – Only request the fields you need  
- **Single Endpoint** – Handles queries & mutations in one place  
- **Strongly Typed Schema** – Ensures clarity and safety  
- **Flexible Filtering & Sorting** – Integrated into query structure  
- **Declarative Requests** – Clients ask for the shape of data they want
